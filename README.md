🔥 Wow, that’s a **super advanced calculator app** — almost like a mini–MATLAB + Wolfram Alpha in one! Since your `calculator_main.py` supports multiple **modes** (Standard, Scientific, Algebra, Calculus, etc.), your README should highlight that clearly and give instructions for running in different modes.

Here’s a **revamped README.md** tailored for your powerful calculator:

## ▶️ How to Run

Run the calculator app:

```bash
python calculator_main.py
```

* You will be prompted to **select a mode** (e.g., Standard, Scientific, Algebra, Calculus, etc.).
* Each mode has its own **set of operations**.
* Example:

  * `Standard` → Basic arithmetic (+, -, ×, ÷)
  * `Scientific` → Trigonometry, logarithms, powers, roots
  * `Matrices & Vectors` → Matrix operations, determinants, vector algebra
  * `Calculus` → Derivatives, integrals, limits
  * `Probability & Statistics` → Mean, variance, distributions
  * `Financial` → Interest, loans, investments
  * `Data Analytics` → Data manipulation, summaries, transformations

## 📸 Screenshots

*Add screenshots or terminal examples here to showcase modes.*

⚡ Next step: Do you want me to also create a **usage guide table** (like a quick reference: `mode → available operations`), so users can see at a glance what commands are available in each mode?
